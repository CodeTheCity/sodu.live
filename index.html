                Whilst tickets have a suggested donation to help with charity
                running costs, this should not be a barrier to anyone attending.

            <h1>The Unconference</h1>
            <p>
                The unconference is the ONLY annual Open Data event in Scotland. It brings together data publishers, data users and infomediaries from a variety of backgrounds: academia, journalism, the public and third sectors, as well as citizens and activists.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is the opportunity to highlight projects, engage with the community, seek feedback, form alliances, kick off new enterprises, seek data and start campaigns that can change policy.
            </p>

        <div class="container">
            <h1>The Format</h1>
            <p>
                This event will follow the open space format, where participants create
                the agenda each morning for the sessions that will happen that day.
                This is the time to pitch your questions to the many people who
                will be there, and to tell others about your project too.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sessions in open space always work best when there is an interactive aspect so that the participants talk as much as the person chairing the session. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_jhcvCYBbg" target="_blank">short video</a> will tell you more about open space. The amazing thing is that it scales really well from 20 people to over 1000 people.
